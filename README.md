<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Aashish Kumar</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Mechanical Engineer 👨🏻‍🔧 on the road to the world of Data and AI</h3>

- 💼 I recently joined **Pepperfry** as an AI engineer, prior to that I was pursuing M.Tech in Engineering analysis and design from the Department of Applied Mechanics, IIT Delhi. During my M.Tech degree, I worked as **Placement Coordinator** of the Applied Mechanics department at the Office of Career Services (Formerly Training and Placement Cell).
- 🔭 My MTech project work was on accelerating metamaterial design using deep learning, which is titled, "𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐝𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠." 
  - The project is centred on using deep learning approaches to design the microstructure of metamaterials, aiming to significantly reduce the time and cost involved in the microstructure topology optimization as compared to conventional techniques.
  - Tools/Techniques used: Deep Learning, CNN, Transfer Learning, Encoder-Decoder, HDF5
  - Framework/Libraries used: PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib and others.
- 🎯 I firmly believe that every industry needs the best in the class team; to rise above traditional methods by filtering and analysing the wind range of data around us, to aim for the bull's eye. Thus, apart from the Mechanical domain, I am learning Programming, Data Science/ML/DL through an [Online B.Sc Degree in Programming and Data Science](https://onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/) by IIT-Madras.
- 🎓 I Graduated in Mechanical Engineering from [Guru Ghasidas University (A Central University)](https://www.ggu.ac.in/) in 2018 with an A+ grade. Later I wrote GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test In Engineering) Exam 2019 and passed with 99.14 percentile (AIR-1426).
- ⚡ When I am not in work or study mode, either I read novels or watch Disney movies. **Believing in the process; One day, I'll know, How far I'll go.** ✌
