🎯: I firmly believe that every industry needs the best in the class team; to rise above traditional methods by filtering and analyzing the wind range of data around us and aiming for the bull's eye. Thus I am building my expertise in Data Science through an online degree in Data Science and Applications from IIT-Madras.

🎓: I have pursued M.Tech in Engineering analysis and design from the Department of Applied Mechanics, IIT Delhi. My MTech project was on accelerating metamaterial design using deep learning, titled "Computational design of Extreme Metamaterials using Deep Learning", and I wrote two research papers around it. 

🎓: I Graduated in Mechanical Engineering from Guru Ghasidas University (A Central University) in 2018 with an A+ grade. Later I wrote GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test In Engineering) Exam 2019 and passed with a 99.14 percentile (AIR-1426).

💡: When I am not working or studying, I read novels (mostly Self-Help and Finance) or watch Disney movies. Believing in the process, One day, I'll know, How far I'll go.
